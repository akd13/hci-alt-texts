# HCI Alt Text Dataset

This repository contains materials (data and code) for the project described in the 2022 ASSETS paper:

```
Sanjana Chintalapati, Jonathan Bragg, Lucy Lu Wang. "A Dataset of Alt Texts from HCI Publications: Analyses and Uses Towards Producing More Descriptive Alt Texts of Data Visualizations in Scientific Papers." ASSETS 2022.
```

We release a dataset of alt text extracted from HCI publications, along with annotations of the types of semantic content included in these alt texts. Most figures in scientific papers lack alt text and we hope this dataset can help to improve the situation.
